Welcome to David Bosch's portfolio.

1. Space Clicker

Space Clicker was a task assigned for students to become more familiar with the Unity workspace. The purpose of this game is to destroy the approaching spaceships by clicking on them. Doing so will award you with points depending on the speed and size of the ship you destroyed. The aim is to get the highest score possible.
