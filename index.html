<br>
Space Clicker was a task assigned for students to become more familiar with the Unity workspace. The purpose of this game is to destroy the approaching spaceships by clicking on them. Doing so will award you with points depending on the speed and size of the ship you destroyed. The aim is to get the highest score possible.<br>
<br>
## 2. Youtube comment section<br>
<br>

<br>
The youtube clone was a task assigned for students to become more familiar with using HTML, CSS and PHP to create a functional youtube comment section. The comments were made functional due to the mySQL database. Information was sent via a form to the database, such as the name, email address and the comment itself. The information was then pulled from this database and displayed under the video. <br>
